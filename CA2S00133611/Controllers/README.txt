This is probably the worst assignment I have had to undertake its really hard to navigate MVC. 
I have created Movie Control Movie Class 
I have added database via entity framework 
I have sourced alot of info online and this has helped and hindered achieve the assignment to this point. 
I tried to get migrations working and ended up having to restart the project as it completely killed my assignment I couldnt roll back
I added some toastr
I have added some ajax which isn't working correctly with partial view and i don't know why yet?
I created a partial view in the shared folders
I added a number of libraries just to try out
I added an image to the home screen 
I added a Genre Selection drop down list to the movie index page which works really well 
I added a Filter button which works if you put your words in the search bar it will come up
I added a text box where you can insert text to search for a movie which also works well
You can Edit , Delete, and view details and create new entry 
I changed the styling using bootstrap
I won't get huge marks but I definitely would like some marks for DropDown List styling please 
tried numerous attempts to get the validation on create working using the [required] it throws an exception when compiling so had to commment it out
Tried to validate with clientside and this locks the whole screen from creating a new movie so I canned that
I am most proud of Dropdownlist styling and Search bar and filter 
I also added two pages Home and Movies just to make the site more interesting 
I tried to spin the Movies picture on the home page but can't do it 
I added a second click button on the home page beside the image that direct you to the Movies page 
Validation was a pain I know I am doing something that is messing it up
found way more difficult than I thought it would be I have a good understanding of how to navigate controllers and view and models 
WIth regards jquery and javascript I found the process very difficult to work with in conjuction with razor
